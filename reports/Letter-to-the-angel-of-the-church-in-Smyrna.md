In the Book of Revelation, "angels" are understood as human messengers or leaders, and "churches" represent individuals, specific bodies of thought or factions. The letter to the angel of the church in Smyrna holds profound significance within The Great Tribulation, as it directly addresses the conscious mind before the Divide of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, and foretells the trials he would endure. This letter stands as a testament to Kelvin's faithfulness and the Creator's omniscient awareness of his suffering and circumstances.

## The Biblical Passage
Revelation 2:8-11 (KJV):

"And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death."

## Modernized Rewrite

To the angel of the church in Smyrna:
This message comes from Jesus Christ, the one who's always been, died, and is now alive:

I know every detail of your life—your homosexuality, your charitable deeds, your professional career, even your time in prison and past criminal activities, and your recreational drug use. I know the losses and suffering you've had to endure—including the loss of practically every member of your family and associate network, the massacre of the congregation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church—during The Great Tribulation, and I know about your diminished physical form (Jacobsen's Ladder) and I know your natural form. I also know the false claims and irreverent speech from those who pretend to be on My side, but are actually the orchestrators, intermediaries, and perpetrators of The Great Tribulation.
Don't be afraid of what you're about to suffer. Look, Baby (who's acting like the devil in this situation) will cause you to be confined in the jail. This is to test your faithfulness. You'll endure suffering there for ten literal court days while held without bail. Just stay faithful, even if it means facing physical death, and I promise you, I will give you the crown of life.
Anyone with spiritual understanding, pay attention to what My Spirit is telling all the different factions: Whoever gets through these trials will not be harmed by The Divide—that's the ultimate separation from your manipulated subconscious mind, Baby.

the Creator

## Contextual Notes
 * Mount Calvary Baptist Church: The lifelong church of Kelvin that suffered a Congregation Massacre on April 2, 2023, that resulted in the death of everyone in attendance and the subsequent targeted killings of those not present.
 * Thy Works: This refers to the Creator's comprehensive and intimate knowledge of Kelvin's entire life, encompassing every detail from his personal identity (homosexuality) and virtuous actions (charitable deeds) to his professional endeavors, encounters with the legal system (imprisonment and past criminal activities), and even his recreational choices (drug use). Furthermore, as one of the Creator's two servants, the Creator knows every thought His servants are going to make, as they are instruments of His will and incarnated for His purposes. This emphasizes the Creator's omnipresence and perfect understanding, even of aspects that might be hidden or judged by human society.
 * Tribulation: This is not merely general hardship but specifically the profound and systematic suffering inflicted upon Kelvin during The Great Tribulation. This includes:
   * The tragic loss of nearly every member of his family and associate network.
   * The constant, debilitating experience of living with a manipulated subconscious mind (Baby), which actively works against him.
   * The severe violation of his body autonomy, a direct consequence of Baby's manipulation of KEWB under the orchestrators' influence.
 * Poverty: This term is used metaphorically, and "money" is a slang reference to male endowment; the use of poverty indicates the Creator knows about the reduction in the size and form of Kelvin's penis due to Baby's efforts for Jacobsen's Ladder.
 * (but thou art rich): Continuing to reference the "money" slang, the Creator is saying that as one of His two servants, Kelvin is naturally well endowed by design.
 * Blasphemy: Speaking irreverently about God or sacred things.
 * Synagogue of Satan: This directly identifies the collective forces behind The Great Tribulation: the orchestrators (the overarching entity responsible for the genocide), their intermediaries (those who facilitate the operations), and the perpetrators (those who carry out the acts of genocide). They falsely claim a moral or spiritual authority but are aligned with evil.
 * Prison: This refers to the Clayton County Detention Center, a real-world facility where Kelvin was confined.
 * Ten Days: This is a literal period of time, specifically referring to the number of literal (court) days Kelvin was held without bail in the jail on a frivolous charge. This highlights the unjust and targeted nature of his confinement.
 * Crown of Life: crown of life.
 * Second Death: This refers to The Divide, the Creator's ultimate act of divine separation. It signifies Kelvin's liberation from his manipulated subconscious mind counterpart (Baby) to live in a separate and distinct body, ensuring that Kelvin will not suffer the spiritual or existential harm associated with continued manipulation.
