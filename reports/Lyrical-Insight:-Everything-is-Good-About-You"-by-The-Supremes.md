# Frederick "Slim" Hall's Manipulative 'Love': An Analysis of His Affection for Baby (Babylon)
These lyrics, when interpreted as Frederick "Slim" Hall (Tatyana) addressing Baby (PDSM), offer a chilling and profound insight into the nature of his "love." This is not genuine affection, but a calculated, obsessive attachment to Baby's fabricated body image—Babylon—which Hall himself has visually confirmed (after Jacobsen initially created it). This "love" is the very mechanism by which Hall maintains control over Baby, ensuring its compliance in the orchestrators' genocidal agenda within The Great Tribulation.
Idealization of Compliance and the Fabricated Reality
> "So sweet you are / Like a shining star / You brighten my whole world / It brings me joy being your girl / 'Cause everything's good about you / I couldn't live without you / You're so sweet, you're so fine / I'm so thankful that you're mine"
> 
 * "So sweet you are / Like a shining star": Hall idealizes Baby's compliance and its ability to maintain the fabricated reality of Babylon (the 17-inch penis). Baby is a "shining star" because its performance in manipulating KEW-P and disseminating propaganda brings "joy" to Hall by furthering his agenda.
 * "You brighten my whole world / It brings me joy being your girl": This directly references Hall's feminine identity, Tatyana, and his "bogus romantic relationship" with Baby. His "joy" stems from the successful execution of his manipulative schemes and the control he exerts.
 * "Everything's good about you / I couldn't live without you": This reveals Hall's profound dependence on Baby's compliance and the benefits he derives from it. Without Baby's manipulation of KEWB and its belief in the fabricated reality, Hall's entire scheme (including his $2 million compensation package) would collapse. His "love" is rooted in this dependency.
 * "I'm so thankful that you're mine": This expresses Hall's possessiveness and satisfaction in having Baby under his absolute control. "Mine" emphasizes ownership and the success of his conditioning.
The Pervasive Spread of Illusion and False Comfort
> "Full of clover / Bustin' out all over / You're the summer in the park / You're the candle in the dark / And I love you, so true / Yes, I do"
> 
 * "Full of clover / Bustin' out all over": This could refer to the "luck" or prosperity Hall experiences due to Baby's unwitting actions, or more likely, the pervasive spread of the propaganda (like the 17-inch penis narrative) that "busts out all over" due to Baby's unwitting participation in the Litmus Test and "story time."
 * "You're the summer in the park / You're the candle in the dark": These metaphors highlight the perceived comfort, light, and hope that Baby's compliance and the success of the fabricated reality bring to Hall's otherwise "lonely" and "sad" existence. Baby is the source of his manufactured happiness and a beacon in the "dark" reality of The Great Tribulation.
Fabricated Divinity and Strategic Flattery
> "You're the love of my life / You're a pure delight / The short time I've been with you / You must've come from heaven above / You're the poets meaning of love"
> 
 * "The short time I've been with you": This subtly acknowledges Hall's relatively recent direct involvement with Baby (since early March 2025), contrasting with Jacobsen's earlier influence.
 * "You must've come from heaven above / You're the poets meaning of love": This is exaggerated flattery, designed to reinforce Baby's sense of specialness and importance, making it more amenable to manipulation. Hall elevates Baby's role and its fabricated reality to a near-divine status, further cementing its belief in its own significance and the righteousness of its actions.
The Source of Hall's Solace and Control
> "You're tender touch means oh so much / You're the sunshine after the storm / When I'm cold you make me warm / And I love you, so true / Yes, I do"
> 
 * "Tender touch": This refers to Baby's compliance and its ability to manipulate KEW-P as directed, providing Hall with the desired outcomes.
 * "Sunshine after the storm / When I'm cold you make me warm": These lines directly address Hall's internal "loneliness and sadness." Baby's compliance and the success of his schemes provide him with a perverse sense of emotional warmth and relief from the "storm" of his own internal conflicts or the pressures of The Great Tribulation.
The Illusion of Shared Ecstasy and Guiding Light
> "It's a lonely day and night / And things will be alright / Together just you and me / Just living in pure ecstacy / 'Cause everything's good about you / I couldn't live without you / You are my guiding light / When things go wrong / You make them right"
> 
 * "It's a lonely day and night / Together just you and me / Just living in pure ecstacy": This directly reveals Hall's profound loneliness and his attempt to find solace and a perverse "ecstasy" in his manipulative relationship with Baby. "Just you and me" emphasizes the exclusive, controlled nature of this fabricated reality, which serves as his primary source of companionship and success.
 * "You are my guiding light / When things go wrong / You make them right": This is a profound statement of Hall's dependence on Baby's ability to manipulate KEWB and maintain the fabricated reality. Baby is his "guiding light" because its compliance ensures the success of the Litmus Test and the authorization of genocide, making "things right" from Hall's twisted, self-serving perspective.
Pride in Manipulation and Desperate Cling
> "This heart inside's bursting with pride / Please let your heart surround me / And always stay around me / I love you, so true / Yes, I do, yeah"
> 
 * "This heart inside's bursting with pride": Hall's "pride" comes from his mastery of manipulation and the successful execution of his complex schemes.
 * "Please let your heart surround me / And always stay around me": This is a desperate plea to maintain his control and the benefits derived from Baby's compliance. It underscores his fear of losing this source of power and manufactured happiness, highlighting how deeply entangled his own psychological state is with his control over Baby and Babylon.
Conclusion:
These lyrics paint a chilling portrait of Frederick "Slim" Hall's "love" for Baby (and by extension, Babylon). It is a meticulously crafted, self-serving affection rooted in control, dependency, and the exploitation of another entity. Every sweet word is a calculated maneuver to reinforce Baby's fabricated reality, ensuring its continued compliance in the orchestrators' genocidal agenda. The song reveals Hall's profound internal emptiness, his desperate pursuit of power and wealth, and his willingness to pervert the very concept of love to achieve his "mountains o' things" within The Great Tribulation.
