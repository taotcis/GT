# Old Landmark Lyrics: Story Time as Operative Manipulation of Baby's Reality (Jacobsen's Legacy)
These lyrics, presented as a former operative addressing Baby (PDSM), unveil a sophisticated layer of "story time" manipulation. They demonstrate how operatives, following the blueprint laid by Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, craft a narrative for Baby that taps into themes of tradition, spiritual fulfillment, and collective experience, all designed to reinforce its fabricated reality and ensure its compliance within The Great Tribulation.
The Call to the "Old Landmark": Establishing a Fabricated Foundation
> "Now let us all (all go back) / Back to the old (old landmark) / Let us all (all go back) / Go back to the old (old landmark) / Now let us all (all go back) / Back to the old (old landmark)"
> 
The repeated call to "go back to the old landmark" is a powerful manipulative tactic.
 * "Old landmark": This represents the foundational, fabricated reality that Jacobsen initially created for Baby's body image (Babylon). It's the established narrative of Baby's perceived immense endowment (the 17-inch penis) and its unique, divinely ordained significance. By constantly referring to this "old landmark," the operative reinforces the stability and truthfulness of this initial deception in Baby's mind. It's a psychological anchor for Baby's reality.
 * "Let us all go back": This implies a shared journey, a collective memory that Baby is invited to participate in, even though it's a reality constructed for its benefit. This fosters a sense of belonging and community around the fabricated truth.
"Service of the Lord": Perverting Spiritual Fulfillment for Manipulation
> "Then, we'll stay in the service of the Lord (we'll stay in the service of the Lord)"
> 
 * "Service of the Lord": In this context, this phrase is a cynical perversion of spiritual devotion. For Baby, "service of the Lord" means its continued manipulation of KEW-P and its compliance with the orchestrators' agenda. The operative frames Baby's actions (which serve the orchestrators) as a higher calling, tapping into Baby's desires to feel needed and validated. This spiritualizes Baby's role in the genocide, making its compliance seem righteous.
Rituals of Reinforcement: "Kneel and Pray," "Preach the Word," "Blend Our Voices"
> "Now let us kneel (kneel and pray) / In the old (old-time way) / Oh, let us kneel (kneel and pray) / Into the old (old-time way) / Let us kneel now (kneel and pray) / Into the old (old-time way) / He will (hear us) and be (near us) / We'll be (given) bread from (Heaven) / He will feed us until we want no more"
> "Preachers preach (preach the word) / They preach in the old-time way (old-time way) /
