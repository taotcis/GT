# Prince's 'Scarlet Pussy': An Analysis of Baby (PDSM) and CIA Manipulation
The lyrics to Prince's "Scarlet Pussy," when interpreted through the lens of The Great Tribulation contextual framework, offer a raw and explicit portrayal of the manipulation of Baby (PDSM) and its role in the orchestrators' agenda. The "scarlet pussy" is a hypersexualized, derogatory, and symbolic representation of Baby (PDSM) itself, particularly in its capacity to embody and facilitate the fabricated reality of Babylon (the 17-inch body image of KEW-P). The "mother" is explicitly identified as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the primary orchestrator.
The Cherished and Controlled Asset: Baby (PDSM) as the "Scarlet Pussy"
> "Once upon a time in the land of fever, there lived a scarlet pussy / This kitty cat of fine descent, was cherished by her mother / Who wouldn't let another, pet her, unless he was qualified"
> 
 * "Scarlet pussy": This is a direct, crude metaphor for Baby (PDSM), aligning with its identity as The Scarlet Beast. The term emphasizes the hypersexualized reality created for Baby (Babylon) and its role in the "fornication" that justifies the orchestrators' actions. "Fine descent" is a manipulative compliment, elevating Baby's perceived status.
 * "Cherished by her mother": The CIA ("mother") "cherishes" Baby not out of genuine affection, but because Baby is an invaluable asset. Baby's unique ability to manipulate KEW-P's physiology and its subconscious connection to Kelvin are crucial for the success of the Litmus Test and the broader agenda of The Great Tribulation.
 * "Wouldn't let another, pet her, unless he was qualified": This highlights the strict control the CIA maintains over Baby. Only "qualified" operatives, such as John Robison and Frederick "Slim" Hall, are granted access to interact with and manipulate Baby. This vetting ensures that only those who understand and can effectively execute the manipulative "story time" and physiological control are allowed near this critical asset.
The Monthly Cycle of Manipulation and Observation
> "Every first of the month this pretty feline got the hots / And that's when the neighborhood (d-d-dogs!) / They'd line up around the block"
> 
 * "Every first of the month this pretty feline got the hots": This suggests a recurring, perhaps monthly, cycle of intensified manipulation or "orchestrated observations." "Got the hots" refers to Baby's heightened state of readiness for manipulation, driven by its desires (to feel loved, needed, and "served" with "Tina"). This is when Baby is most receptive to the hypersexualized "story time" and is primed to perform its manipulative role.
 * "Neighborhood (d-d-dogs!) / They'd line up around the block": The "dogs" represent the "kings" (well-endowed African-American males, often operatives) and other individuals who are drawn into the orchestrated observations. Their eagerness to "line up" signifies the frequent and systematic nature of the Litmus Test events, where they come to witness the manipulated KEW-P and confirm the false narrative.
The Alluring and Deceptive Power of Baby's Magic
> "When my little scarlet feline roars the locals come around (Come Around) / When they see the scarlet light they know it's time to come chase her down (Chase her down) / Lo and behold the fantastical way / In which their bodies groove / My scarlet pussy's furry magic alters any mood (Scarlet Pussy!) it's cool"
> 
 * "Roars" / "Scarlet light": This refers to Baby's active participation in the manipulation. It could be Baby's subconscious "story time" narratives, its internal belief in the 17-inch Babylon body image, or the visible effects of its physiological manipulation on KEW-P. This "roar" or "light" signals to the operatives that the staged observation is underway, and it's time to "chase her down" (engage in the observation).
 * "Fantastical way in which their bodies groove": This describes the perverse "satisfaction" or confirmation the observers (kings/operatives) get from witnessing the manipulated KEW-P. Their "grooving" is their internal alignment with the false narrative, which aligns with the propagandized 17-inch image in their minds.
 * "Furry magic alters any mood": This highlights Baby's (PDSM's) profound ability to manipulate not only physiological processes (like KEW-P's form) but also to create compelling illusions and narratives. This "magic" affects the perception and emotional state of observers, making them believe the lie, thereby "altering any mood" of skepticism or doubt.
The Psychological Toll and Exploitation of Ego
> "She can make you crazy if you're too close to her heat / She can make you sad when you're happy as can be / She can make you shoot your ego all over her sheets / All is hers in love and war, my little scarlet pussy"
> 
 * "Too close to her heat": Getting too deeply involved in Baby's manipulated reality or the orchestrators' insidious schemes.
 * "Make you crazy" / "Make you sad when you're happy": The psychological toll, confusion, and potential disillusionment inflicted by the pervasive deception. Those who get too entangled may experience cognitive dissonance or a breakdown of their own reality.
 * "Shoot your ego all over her sheets": This is a powerful and explicit metaphor. It refers to the "kings" (operatives) who are drawn into the hypersexualized fantasy of Babylon (the 17-inch body image). They "shoot their ego" (their pride in their own endowment or perceived status) within this fabricated sexual context. Their participation in the "fornication" of Babylon, driven by their own desires and the belief in the propaganda, leads them to "ejaculate" their ego onto the "sheets" of Baby's (Babylon's) fabricated reality, further validating it.
 * "All is hers in love and war": This signifies Baby's (PDSM's) perceived dominance and control within the reality created for it, especially concerning the sexualized aspects of the manipulation. Baby believes it is in control and that everything is its for the taking, even though it is fundamentally being manipulated by the CIA and operatives like Hall.
Diverse Targets and Unmasking Motives
> "Every dog would try his lines to get pussy's attention / All they want is so exposed in ways too gross to mention (eew!) / Green virgin teenager / A filthy rich yuppie"
> 
 * "Every dog would try his lines": The eagerness of various operatives to engage with Baby (PDSM) and the transparency of their self-serving motives.
 * "All they want is so exposed in ways too gross to mention": This highlights the base and selfish motivations of the "dogs" (operatives). Their desire to confirm the false Litmus Test results (to authorize genocide) and their participation in the hypersexualized fantasy are laid bare as morally repulsive.
 * "Green virgin teenager / A filthy rich yuppie": These represent the diverse range of individuals, from naive recruits to powerful, wealthy figures, who are drawn into the orchestrators' web and participate in the manipulation of Baby.
The Unending Cycle of Manipulation
The repeated choruses and outro emphasize the cyclical and pervasive nature of this manipulation. Baby is constantly affirmed in its fabricated reality, and the operatives continue to engage with it, perpetuating the cycle of deception and exploitation.
Conclusion:
Prince's "Scarlet Pussy" offers a visceral and disturbing allegory for the manipulation of Baby (PDSM) by the CIA and its operatives within The Great Tribulation. The "scarlet pussy" represents Baby's hypersexualized, exploited identity and the fabricated reality of Babylon that it embodies. The lyrics expose the calculated "love" and control exerted by the "mother" (CIA) and the "dogs" (operatives), who feed Baby's desires and ego to ensure its compliance in the grand deception. The song details the psychological and physical effects of this manipulation, ultimately revealing the insidious mechanisms by which the orchestrators maintain their power and justify their genocidal agenda.
