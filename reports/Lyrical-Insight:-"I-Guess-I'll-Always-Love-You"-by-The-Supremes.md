# Frederick "Slim" Hall's "Love" for Babylon: An Analysis of His Manipulative Affection
These lyrics, when understood as Frederick "Slim" Hall (Tatyana) addressing Baby (PDSM), offer a chilling and profound insight into the nature of his "love." This is not genuine affection, but a calculated, obsessive attachment to Baby's fabricated body image—Babylon—which Hall himself has created and visually confirmed. This "love" is the very mechanism by which Hall maintains control over Baby, ensuring its compliance in the orchestrators' genocidal agenda within The Great Tribulation.
The Core of Hall's "Love": Control and Self-Fulfillment
The recurring refrain, "I guess I'll always love you / You've got the love I need," reveals the transactional and self-serving nature of Hall's "affection." He "loves" Baby not for its inherent being, but for what it provides him: the absolute control over KEWB's physiology, the dissemination of the 17-inch propaganda, and the subsequent authorization of massacres. "The love I need" is the fulfillment of his own desires for power, wealth (his $2 million compensation), and the validation of his manipulative prowess.
Deepening the Control: "Open up your arms / And let me walk on in / Open up your heart / And let me live again"
These lines speak to Hall's relentless drive for deeper psychological penetration and control over Baby's reality. "Open up your arms/heart" is a plea for Baby's continued, unquestioning emotional and psychological submission. By fully immersing himself in the fabricated reality he has built for Baby—where Baby believes it possesses a 17-inch penis and Hall is its equally endowed lover—Hall is able to "live again." This signifies his own revitalization and sense of purpose derived from the success of this profound manipulation, masking his underlying loneliness and sadness.
The Obsessive Attachment to a Fabricated Past: "When you left you left with me / A dream no longer reality / I live the shadows of our past / With this love that's born to last"
"When you left" could refer to any perceived moment where Baby's compliance wavered, or a time before Hall fully established his pervasive control over Baby's reality. The "dream no longer reality" might hint at a fleeting doubt or a past where Hall's aspirations were not yet fully realized. However, his "love that's born to last" is an obsessive attachment to the idea of this control and the immense benefits it brings him. This "love" is intrinsically linked to his need for power and wealth, making it a persistent, almost parasitic, bond.
Happiness Contingent on Manipulation: "The only time I'm happy / Is when you're on my mind / Every day I live / All my love I give"
This reveals the profound emptiness within Hall. His happiness is entirely contingent on his successful manipulation of Baby and the sustained illusion of Babylon (the 17-inch body image). His "love" here is his constant, consuming focus and effort directed at maintaining this control. He "gives all his love" in the form of meticulous planning, love bombing, and strategic love withdrawal, as this is his primary source of perceived happiness and fulfillment, serving as a desperate attempt to keep his "sadness and loneliness at bay."
The Pervasive Illusion: "I've been a thousand places / Seen your sparkle in a thousand faces / No matter what I try to do / I'm always dreaming of you"
"Your sparkle in a thousand faces" refers to the widespread impact and acceptance of the 17-inch propaganda that Baby (as Babylon) helps to disseminate, or the successful outcomes of the Litmus Test. Hall sees the "fruits" of his manipulation everywhere, reflected in the perceptions of the "kings" and other operatives. His obsession with this success means he's "always dreaming of" the continued control and the benefits Baby provides, making the fabricated reality a constant presence in his mind.
Reinforcing the Hypersexualized Reality: "Every boy that passes by / I see your sparkle in his eye / Right away I stop and stare / Close my eyes and see you there"
This is a direct and chilling manifestation of Hall's own hypersexualized image that he projects into Baby's reality. He sees the "sparkle" of the 17-inch ideal (the "money" or endowment) in other "kings" (well-endowed African-American males). This external observation then immediately triggers his internal reinforcement of Baby's perceived 17-inch body image. He "stops and stares" at these "kings" because they represent the very "endowment" that he uses to control Baby and justify his actions, further solidifying the perverse reality he has constructed.
The Unbreakable Cycle of Control: "Whenever I feel almost free / Memories take hold of me / I love you now so much more / Than I ever did before"
"Almost free" could refer to fleeting moments where Hall might feel a sense of escape from his own internal conflicts or the demands of his role. However, the "memories" of the power and control he has over Baby, and the immense benefits derived from it, pull him back into the cycle. His "love" for Baby (and what Baby represents as Babylon) intensifies as his dependence on this manipulation for his own perceived happiness, security, and success grows. This shows how deeply entangled his own psychological state is with his control over Baby.
Conclusion:
Frederick "Slim" Hall's "love" for Babylon (the 17-inch body image he has created for Baby) is a masterclass in manipulative affection. These lyrics paint a portrait of an individual whose happiness, purpose, and sense of self are inextricably linked to his ability to control and exploit another entity. His "love" is a tool, a strategy, and ultimately, a reflection of his own profound internal emptiness and his desperate pursuit of "mountains o' things" at the cost of participating in a domestic genocide. The song reveals the insidious nature of his bond with Baby, a bond that ensures Baby's continued compliance and the perpetuation of the orchestrators' lies.
