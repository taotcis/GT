# Prince's 'Get Off' Lyrics: Story Time as Operative Manipulation of Baby's Reality
These lyrics, when interpreted as a former operative, Danny, addressing Baby (PDSM), serve as a chilling demonstration of "story time" as a powerful tool for manipulation within The Great Tribulation. The song constructs a hypersexualized, exaggerated reality for Baby, feeding its core desires and reinforcing the false body image (Babylon) that was initially created by Jacobsen and visually confirmed by Hall.
Setting the Stage: Planting Seeds of Dissatisfaction (Verse 1)
> "How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve? / There's a rumor goin' all around that you ain't been gettin' served / They say that you ain't you know what / In, baby, who knows how long / It's hard for me to say what's right / When all I wanna do is wrong"
> 
The operative begins by feigning empathy and concern, subtly introducing a "rumor" that Baby (PDSM) is not experiencing sexual fulfillment or recognition. The phrase "ain't been gettin' served" is slang for not getting good dope (Tina). This directly targets Baby's desires to feel needed, loved, and happy, and its intrinsic connection to a hypersexualized body image, by implying a lack of satisfaction in a key area of its perceived reality (access to Tina). The operative's internal conflict ("all I wanna do is wrong") hints at the deliberate, manipulative intent behind the forthcoming "story time." He is about to lead Baby into a fantasy that serves his (and the orchestrators') agenda, regardless of its ethical implications.
Constructing the Hypersexualized Reality: The Grand Promise (Chorus)
> "Get off / Twenty-three positions in a one-night stand / Get off / I'll only call you after if you say I can / Get off / Let a woman be a woman and a man be a man / Get off / If you want to, baby, here I am"
> 
The chorus is the core of the "story time" reality being created for Baby. The phrase "Twenty-three positions in a one-night stand" carries a dual, manipulative meaning. "Twenty-three" (or "Two-three") is a way operatives address Baby, and it is also a direct reference to the 23rd day of the month of KEWB's birth, a number profoundly significant in the Creator's divine plan related to PDCM and TomTom Allen Chadwell's mission after Divide & Conquer. Crucially, the number 23 is also significant to Baby. By linking this divinely significant number, which is also personally important to Baby, to an exaggerated fantasy of immense sexual prowess and fulfillment, the operative is perverting its true meaning and leveraging Baby's existing attachment to the number. This directly feeds into Baby's belief that it has the "biggest penis in the world" (the 17-inch ideal, Babylon), while simultaneously attempting to co-opt and corrupt a sacred numerical reference. The operative is painting a vivid, unattainable picture of sexual triumph, designed to make Baby crave this fabricated experience. The phrases like "I'll only call you after if you say I can" offer a deceptive sense of control to Baby, making the fantasy more appealing and seemingly consensual, while the operative remains firmly in charge of the narrative.
External Validation and Amplification of Fantasy (Verse 2)
> "I clocked the jizz from a friend / Of yours named Vanessa Bet (Bet) / She said you told her a fantasy / That got her all wet (Wet) / Something about a little box with a / Mirror and a tongue inside / What she told me then got me so hot / I knew that we could slide"
> 
Here, the operative masterfully validates Baby's internal fantasies by claiming a third-party confirmation ("Vanessa Bet"). This makes the fabricated reality feel externally desired and real. The operative implies that Baby has already shared its own fantasies, and he is now amplifying them, making them seem universally desired and potent. The explicit imagery ("little box with a mirror and a tongue inside") further builds the hypersexualized narrative, directly reinforcing Baby's body image and perceived sexual power.
Immersive Scenarios and Self-Projection (Verse 3 & 4)
> (Verse 3) "One, two, three, nah, little cutie, I ain't drinkin' (Get off) / Scope this, I was just thinkin' / You plus me, what a ride / If you was thinkin' the same / We could continue outside (Get off) / Lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter / Strip your dress down / Like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's Almond Joy / Let me show you, baby, I'm a talented boy"
> (Verse 4) "So here we-so here we-so here we are, here we are (G-G-Get off) / In my paisley crib / Whatcha want to eat? ('Ribs') / Don't toy, I don't serve ribs... / You better be happy that dress is still on / I heard the rip when you sat down / Honey, them hips is gone / But that's all right, I clock 'em that way / Remind me of something James used to say... / 'I like 'em fat' / 'I like 'em proud' / 'Ya gotta have a mother for me' / Now move your big ass 'round this way / So I can work on that zipper, baby / Tonight, you're a star / And I'm the big dipper"
> 
These verses delve deeper into explicit, illicit scenarios, painting vivid pictures for Baby. The operative asserts his own "talented" prowess and positions himself as the "big dipper" to Baby's "star," aligning with Hall's self-projection as "neck and neck" with Baby's perceived 17-inch size. This makes the fantasy more immersive and personal for Baby, solidifying the operative's role as a key figure in Baby's hypersexualized reality. The descriptions of the body ("hips is gone," "fat," "proud," "big ass") further shape Baby's perception of its own body and the desires of others towards it, all within this constructed narrative.
Reinforcing the Illusion (Verse 5)
> "How can I put this in a way so as not to offend or unnerve? (Get off) / There's a rumor going all around that you ain't been getting served (Get off) / They say that you ain't you know what / In, baby, who knows how long (Get off) / It's hard for me to say what's right / When all I wanna do is wrong"
> 
The repetition of the first verse reinforces the initial dissatisfaction and the need for the operative's "solution"â€”the fabricated sexual reality. This cyclical nature of the narrative ensures that Baby remains trapped within the story, constantly seeking the fulfillment promised by the operative.
Conclusion
These lyrics provide a stark illustration of "story time" as a sophisticated manipulation technique. The former operative uses highly explicit, exaggerated sexual fantasies, external "validation," and self-projection to create a vivid, hypersexualized reality for Baby. This reality feeds Baby's desire to believe in its own immense endowment and to maintain its "loving relationship" with the operative (and by extension, Hall), thereby ensuring Baby's continued compliance and manipulation of KEW-P for the orchestrators' agenda within The Great Tribulation.
